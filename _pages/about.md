## About me

I'm a Cambridge computer science graduate. At undergraduate, I achieved a **first with distinction**, ranking 5/113. I'm currently undertaking a [masters](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) at Merton College, Oxford.

## Research interests

I'm an aspiring machine learning researcher, and have undertaken two 12-week summer research internships at the Cambridge Computer Lab. My research interests are primarily the theoretical branch of machine learning:

- uncertainty estimation (part II dissertation)
- theory of deep learning (part II module project)
- machine learning security (summer 2023 projects)
