## about me

I'm a Cambridge computer science graduate. At undergraduate, I achieved a **first with distinction**, ranking 5/113. I'm currently undertaking a [masters](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) at Merton College, Oxford.

## current focus

I'm interested in work with motivating practical applications and optionally underpinning theoretical justification.
To this end, much of my recent work and research interests are theoretical machine learning with practical applications:

- mechanistic interpretability (reading group)
- uncertainty estimation (part II dissertation)
- theory of deep learning (part II module project)
- machine learning security (summer 2023 projects)

Much of my free time is spend reading articles, books and papers on interesting topics briefly mentioned elsewhere.
